README:  
This program contains 3 games.Slots, Black Jack, and 5 Card Poker. Each game works, to my knowledge, as I have tested the possibilities of different winnings in each game. 
I initially coded slots and blackjack, and then I coded 5 card poker for extra credit. The transfer of the chip amounts does work and the menu options work as well. 
 
SLOTS GAME:
The slots game allows the user place in a bet first. After the bet, asks for the user's name. 
The user's name is then displayed with the words "name's slot game". After the user enters there name, the slots game pops up and shows the random numbers generated. 
If the user has any of the winning combinations, it shows  that they win and how many chips they have left. Depending on the chance of the win, it multiplies the bet by how rare the win is. 
After that, it asks if they would like to play again, if not, it asks if they want to go to the menu. 
If not, the program ends. If the user ends up having 0 chips at the end of the game, is still asks both question but will force the end of the program.

BLACKJACK GAME:
The blackjack game starts off with asking the user how much they want to bet. When they place their bet, the dealer pulls two cards first and then the player pulls two cards. 
Then it asks if the player would like to hit another card, if not, the dealer continues to pull for him self if he has less than 21 or a 17 hard. 
If the player chooses to hit another card, it gives the user how much he has in total. After that depending on the winning or losing condition it ounces if the dealer or user wins. 
It then displays the amount of chips left. After that, it asks if they would like to play again, if not, it asks if they want to go to the menu. If not, the program ends. 
If the user ends up having 0 chips at the end of the game, is still asks both question but will force the end of the program. 

5 CARD POKER:
The game begins with asking the user how much they want to bet. 
It then explains how each winning possibility is multiplied by a certain amount. it then pulls 5 random cards for the user. 
It then asks if the user would like to switch any cards and notes that they can only switch each card once. If the user clicks yes, it ask which card it would like to switch. 
For example, if they want to switch their Card Five : ..., the user would type in 5. Then it would give them a new card. 
If they didn't chose to switch or are done switching, it then tells if they won or lost and multiplies the bet by the chance of the win. After that, it asks if they would like to play again, if not, it asks if they want to go to the menu. 
If not, the program ends. If the user ends up having 0 chips at the end of the game, is still asks both question but will force the end of the program. 

END:
If the user decides not to play anymore games and has money left over, it tells them how much they have at the end and says that they are finish. They program then stops.
